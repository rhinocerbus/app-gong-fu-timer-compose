# app-composite-build-template

## Description
App for managing a Gong Fu tea brewing session, which consists of several, short steepings after a longer initial steep.
Timings for these steepings can vary with the type of tea, so presets are provided along with some standard baseline values.

Completed in around 4 hours, including multipole ui design passes as well as adding more features to private libraries for shared components.

## Tech stack
Just Compose, coroutines. 
An additional layer of features could be added, including a local/remote db to store settings for tea types provided by the user, with local storage for last tea selected, plus tracking most-brewed teas. Since this is a personal-use tool, I don't particularly care to have that feature set at the momnet.
